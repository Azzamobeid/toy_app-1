# Toy App Project

This is a rudimentary Rails web application from [Chapter 2 of Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app).

This was completed for this [Odin Project Lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/getting-your-feet-wet).

## Learned

1. Scaffolding automatically creates a bunch of code to model data. However, it is for newbs (like me at this moment).

2. Rails is used in the context of the MVC pattern and REST architecture.

3. Rails lets you validate data to place constraints on data model attributes.

4. Rails has associations which are super powerful -- I will find out why later.

5. `$ rails console` is like a REPL with the application data injected into it.
